# QuickCriteria: Automated Statistical Analysis Tool in MATLAB

QuickCriteria is a MATLAB-powered application for automated processing and statistical evaluation of experimental data.

## Features

The software provides tools for statistical analysis, including normality tests, outlier detection, and diagnostics of systematic errors using various goodness-of-fit criteria. It also calculates key statistical parameters such as the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of datasets.

**QuickCriteria** not only evaluates data reliability but also enables comprehensive visualization: plotting distribution histograms, overlaying theoretical curves, and approximating experimental relationships with polynomials of optimal degree. Its flexible settings allow customization for diverse applications, whether scientific research, engineering calculations, or quality control.

With seamless MATLAB integration, users can further customize algorithms to meet specific requirements, extending the software's functionality for specialized tasks.
